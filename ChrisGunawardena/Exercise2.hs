-- Redo exercise 4 of Workshop 1 and test the property for integer lists of the form [1..n]. You can use subsequences :: [a] -> [[a]] for the list of all subsequences of a given list.
-- Is the property hard to test? If you find that it is, can you given a reason why?
-- Give your thoughts on the following issue: when you perform the test for exercise 4, what are you testing actually? Are you checking a mathematical fact? Or are you testing whether subsequences satisfies a part of its specification? Or are you testing something else still?
